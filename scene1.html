        <h2>Deaths per million vs. Cases per million</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span>
                The European continent dominates the list of countries with deaths of more than 2000 per million.  What's common among these countries - societies which are largely open in culture.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span>
                Among the European countries, Eastern Europe had more deaths per million as compared to Western Europe. Countries like Bulgaria, Hungary, Bosnia, North Macedonia, and Romania had more deaths per million despite having fewer cases per million. This can also indicate testing and isolation of the population lagging behind other countries. More tests increase the number of reported cases, leading to the timely isolation of affected patients and reducing the number of deaths.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> 
                Countries like Germany, France, and Portugal have significantly higher cases per million but fewer deaths per million within the European countries.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"/></span> 
                What is noticeable is that except Tunisia, there is no Asian country with more than 2000 deaths per million. 
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-10"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"/></span> 
                Peru stands out as the country with the most deaths per million, even other countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico feature in the set with more than 2000 deaths per million. 
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-30"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"/></span>
                The United States despite being a rich country with substantial access to vaccines and testing resources, has a high rate of deaths per million.  US deaths exceed the other G7 countries like Germany, France, Italy, and the UK.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-30"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"/></span>
                Besides the US, Italy shows high deaths per million, as some of the Chinese returned from China with the COVID-19 virus and Italy got an early spike in Covid cases when protocols were not established and vaccination was still missing.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-30"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"/></span>
                Large number of Asian countries are part of the chart with deaths less than 2000 per million. South Korea, Brunei, and Singapore did more testing and they had more reported cases and fewer deaths per million.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-30"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"/></span>
                Several Asian and African countries had fewer reported cases per million but relatively higher deaths per million which possibly indicates the nonavailability of testing kits and the relative absence of resources for testing.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-30"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"/></span>
                What is interesting is that even less developed countries seem to have managed to control deaths vis-a-vis the Western nations.
            </li>
            <li class="font-size-lg mt-30"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"/></span>
                China reported deaths until March 2020, however, the data went completely missing thereafter. India had one of the lowest deaths per million at 379.
